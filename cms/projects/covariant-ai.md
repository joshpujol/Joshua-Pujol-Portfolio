AIÂ Robotics for the future
--------------------------

Since the first industrial robots were introduced in the 1960s, millions have been deployed globally. Their impact is undeniable. Robots have automated countless dangerous, repetitive tasks, transforming manufacturing, but they've only reached a fraction of their potential. Incapable of thinking on their own, they can only do pre-programmed tasks in tightly-controlled environments. They can't understand, learn, or adapt.

Building on their experience at Berkeley and OpenAI, Covariant's vision is the Covariant Brain: universal AI that allows robots to see, reason, and act on the world around them. They are bringing the Covariant Brain to commercial viability, starting with the industries that make, move and store things in the physical world.
