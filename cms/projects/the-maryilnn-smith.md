Welcome Miss Personality
------------------------

Marilynn dedicated her life to the advancement of young women through athletic and educational achievement. Since 1999 the Marilynn Smith Scholarship Fund has awarded over 1 Million dollars in scholarships to aspiring female collegiate golfers. This fundraising is achieved through Marilynn's Pro-Am tournament and a percentage of the proceeds from this site.

The Marilynn Smith Scholarship is granted annually through The LPGA Foundation and the Marilynn Smith Scholarship Fund. Established in 1999 by Marilynn with the proceeds of a golf tournament she organized, the objective of the Marilynn Smith Scholarship is to provide a scholarship to a female high school senior who has played golf in high school or in her community and is planning to play golf at an accredited college or university in the United States.
