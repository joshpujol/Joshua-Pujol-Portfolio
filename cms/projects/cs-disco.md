World-class engineering with a deep love and respect for the law.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

DISCO was initially developed at a litigation boutique in Houston. It was born out of the firm’s frustration with conventional ediscovery tools that were slow and difficult for lawyers to use. Instead of being forced to adapt our work methods to technology, we wanted to invent technology that works the way lawyers work. DISCO was the result, and today we are the fastest-growing ediscovery solution in North America.  
  
As the leading provider of software as a service solutions developed by lawyers for lawyers, DISCO is reinventing legal technology to automate and simplify complex and error-prone tasks that distract from practicing law. DISCO has been embraced by more than 400 law firms, including 75 of the top Am Law 200, as their first choice for innovative technologies that enhance the practice of law to help secure justice and win cases.
