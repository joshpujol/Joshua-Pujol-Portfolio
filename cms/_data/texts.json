Duis cursus, mi quis viverra ornare, eros dolor interdum nulla, ut ","7c615d3a":"Ever since I was a child I loved to create. It didn't matter what the medium was, I knew I wanted to put my signature on the world and express my creativity. To design is much more than simply to assemble, to order, or even to edit, it is to add value and meaning through creativity. I feel that my professional career has benefited greatly from my hobbies. From dance to volunteering, photography to drawing, my passions have shaped me into the person I am today.","3670396d":"“Whitespace is like air: it is necessary for design to breathe.” – Wojciech Zieliński","-196052c9":"Cinematography","-65df427f":"Video testimonials, motion graphics, travel videos, you name it! I love working a camera and editing powerful content. Video is a powerful medium but there is nothing I love capturing more than the beauty of our Planet. There is so much untapped beauty in the world. I created this piece with footage I captured from across Australia. I made this as a reminder to myself and others to cherish the beauty that surrounds us and make the best of every precious day.","-38f29e83":"Photography","-4f7bfad7":"A photo is worth a thousand words right? Right! Photography is the only language that can be understood anywhere in the world. I find that very powerful. Few things make me happier than grabbing my DSLR and heading into a new frontier. Below are some of my favorite photographs I have taken on my journey. ","3797efd4":"Artwork","31cefc5f":"Ever since I was a child I was always doodling. I find drawing to be one of the freest forms of creativity as there are no rules. Just the medium and limitless possibilities. My favorite medium is Digital painting. I do all my artwork in photoshop with nothing but a tablet and pen. ","3ebff93":"Dance","3bde08c7":"If there was one form of creativity that truly defined who I am it would undoubtably be Dance. I was 11 years old when I took my first dance class and I know immediately I would dance till the day I die. 16 years later after working on several professional companies. I believe dancing has shaped my skills as a creative in many ways. Video editing, Animation, and Motion graphics all tell a story through motion in a way not so different from a choreographed dance piece.","4dc28":"Volenteering","1a6a967d":"Giving back to the community is very important to me. Whether it is in your own community or across the globe. I spent a few months traveling India and teaching hundreds of boys in orphanages breakdancing, to monthly volunteering at the food bank to helping build community gardens and teaching children in STEM programs. I am so grateful my company does so much philanthropy. I created this video for my colleague and friend who runs DISCO Cares.","-76f3a9e0":"Lets work together!","-e192c55":"Want to get in touch? Send me a message! I am always looking for freelance work or to collaborate on projects.
